# Number Guessing Game (Java)

A simple console-based number guessing game written in Java.

## Files
- `NumberGuessingGame.java` (entry point)

## Requirements
- Java JDK 17+ installed and on your PATH

## How to Run
From this folder in a terminal (PowerShell on Windows):

```bash
javac NumberGuessingGame.java
java NumberGuessingGame
```

## Gameplay
- The program randomly selects a number in a range (commonly 1â€“100).
- Enter guesses; you'll receive feedback like "Too high" or "Too low".
- Continue until you guess correctly; the game reports attempts taken.

## Notes
- If you see a `java: not found` or version error, ensure JDK is installed and `java -version` shows the expected version.
